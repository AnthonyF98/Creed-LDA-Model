A Thousand Faces,Original,"
[Verse 1]
I stand surrounded by the walls that once confined me
Knowing I'll be underneath them
When they crumble when they fall
With clarity my scars remind me
Ash still simmers just under my skin
[Pre-Chorus]
Difference smiles again
So much I hide
How is stepping back a move forward?
[Chorus]
Now I'm forced to look behind
I'm forced to look at you
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell me which is you
Broken mirrors paint the floor
Why can't you see the truth
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell me which is you
Tell me which is you
[Verse 2]
Eerily time made no change
Pointing fingers, laying blame
Lying over and over and over and over
Deceiving your mind
Dug my grave, trash my name
Yet here I stand so you won't fade away
[Pre-Chorus]
Difference smiles again
So much I hide
How is stepping back a move forward?
[Chorus]
Now I'm forced to look behind
I'm forced to look at you
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell me which is you
Broken mirrors paint the floor
Why can't you see the truth
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell me which is you
Tell me which is you
[Bridge]
I bleed inside
Just let it out
Just let it out
I bleed inside
Just let it out
I'm going to let it out
Just let it out
Just let it out
Let it die
[Chorus]
Now I'm forced to look behind
I'm forced to look at you
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell me which is you
Broken mirrors paint the floor
Why can't you see the truth
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell me which is you
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me which is you
[Outro]
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me which is you
Tell me which is you

The sun rises to another day
My constitution keeps changing till it slips away
So I lie awake and stare
My mind thinking, just wondering does anybody care

Should I stay or go?
Should I sleep or stay awake?
Am I really happy or is it all

Sitting in my room now
Hiding thoughts, just hoping one day I'll get out
I hear a voice call my name
Breaking trance so silent, so I can stay the same

Away in Silence,Original,"
[Verse 1]
You walked away in silence, you walked away to breathe
Stopped and turned around to say goodbye to me
I'm pleading as you're leaving, I'm begging you to stay
I'm not the man I used to be, I've changed
I'm not the man I used to be, I've changed
[Chorus]
Don't give up on us, don't give up on love
Don't give up on us, don't give up on love
If my life is the price, then my life it will cost
Now that I'm picking up the pieces, see the pain that I have caused
It's hard to believe in someone you thought was lost
Don't give up on us, don't give up on love
Don't you walk away in silence
[Verse 2]
In tears you counted reasons, tears covered you it seemed
Face down screaming ""God, help me please""
I'm pleading as you're leaving, I'm begging you to stay
I'm not the man I used to be, I've changed
I'm not the man I used to be, I've changed

So close your eyes
Here's your surprise

But, beautiful is empty
Beautiful is free
Beautiful loves no one

Stripped me

Bound and Tied,Original,"
[Verse 1]
Tongue-tied, restless, and wanting
Looks like you might bite, you might bite
Breathing in, breathing out, you're weakened
The poison's hit your mind, your mind
Time's ticking and its got you thinking
You're happy with your life, your life
You're jaded, slated and singled out
By all those chains that bind, that bind
[Chorus]
Take a jet plane my way lately
Because now you are mine, you are mine
This airplane's going my way
'Cause now you're bound and tied
You're bound and tied
You're bound and tied
[Verse 2]
Now sit and reflect on all the fame
Time to dim your light, your light
Zooming in, zooming out, you're questioning
For that there is no crime, no crime
You're cheated, slated and singled out
By all those chains they bind, they bind
[Chorus]
Take a jet plane my way lately
Because now you are mine, you are mine
This airplane's going my way
'Cause now you're bound and tied

Bread of Shame,Original,"

If you say I'm alive I guess I'm living
Why should I exercise a choice I've been given
Tell me everything's fine and peace is coming
I won't listen to the heartache I'm numbing

When the world casts me down and says I've changed
I'll survive on all the promises you made to me
Guess there's no one to blame
When all you're living on is bread of shame

Bread of shame
When the world says I've changed
Bread of shame
Just promise me fame I'll survive on the bread of shame
[Verse 2]
As long as you say I'm free, then keep these chains on me
Tell me down is up, I'll let you fill this broken cup
When the walls fall down, let them fall on me
'Cause no one's around who believes me

When the world casts me down and says I've changed
I'll survive on all the promises you made to me

Bullets,Original,"
[Intro]
Walking around I hear the sounds of the earth seeking relief
I'm trying to find a reason to live
But the mindless clutter my path
Oh, these thorns in my side
Oh, these thorns in my side
I know I have something free
I have something so alive
I think they shoot 'cause they want it
I think they shoot 'cause they want it
I think they shoot 'cause they want it!
[Verse 1]
I feel forces all around me
Come on, raise your head
Those who hide behind the shadows
Live with all that's dead
[Chorus]
Look at me! Look at me! Look at me!
At least look at me when you shoot a bullet through my head
Through my head, through my head
[Verse 2]
In my lifetime when I'm disgraced
Jealousy and lies
I laugh aloud 'cause my life
Has gotten inside someone else's mind

Look at me! Look at me! Look at me!
At least look at me when you shoot a bullet through my head
Through my head, through my head

Something I touch and can feel
I'll hold it close and never let it go
Said why, why do we live this life
With all this hate inside?
I'll give it away 'cause I don't want it no more
Please, help me find a place
Somewhere far away
Yes, I'll go and you'll never see me again

And I just can't see the light
A silver lining sometimes isn't enough
To make some wrongs seem right

Faceless Man,Original,"
[Verse 1]
I spent a day by the river
It was quiet and the wind stood still
I spent some time with nature
To remind me of all that's real
It's funny how silence speaks sometimes when you're alone
And remember that you feel
I said it's funny how silence speaks sometimes when you're alone
And remember that you feel
[Chorus]
Again I stand, Lord, I stand
Against the faceless man
Again I stand, Lord, I stand
Against the faceless man
[Verse 2]
Now I saw a face on the water
It looked humble but willing to fight
I saw the will of a warrior
His yoke is easy and his burden is light
He looked me right in the eyes, direct and concise to remind me
To always do what's right
He looked me right in the eyes, direct and concise to remind me
To always do what's right
[Chorus]
Again I stand, Lord, I stand
Against the faceless man
Again I stand, Lord God, I stand
Against the faceless man
[Verse 3]
Because if the face inside can't see the light, I know
I'll have to walk alone
And if I walk alone to the other side, I know
I might not make it home
[Chorus]
Again I stand, Lord, I stand
Against the faceless man
Again I stand, Lord, I stand
Against the faceless man
[Bridge]
Next time I see this face, I'll say
I choose to live for always
So won't you come inside
And never go away?
Next time I see this face, I'll say
I choose to live for always
So won't you come inside
And never go away?

Too many battles we fighting and we winning, we going up high its a victory flight
Counting em blessings this life is amazing we are now elevating we are amongst the stars

Mmmh better mind what you saying because you know about the power of the tongue
Life is amazing I say it's amazing but staying with God is way better than that

Freedom Fighter,Original,"
[Verse 1]
The mouths of envious always find another door
While at the gates of paradise they beat us down some more
Our mission's set in stone because the writing's on the wall
I'll scream it from the mountain tops pride comes before a fall
[Verse 2]
So many thoughts to share, all this energy to give
Unlike those who hide the truth, I tell it like it is
If the truth will set you free I feel sorry for your soul
Can't you hear the ringing? 'Cause for you the bell tolls
[Chorus]
I'm just a freedom fighter, no remorse
Raging on in holy war
Soon there'll come a day
When you're face to face with me
Face to face with me
Face to face with me
Face to face with me
[Bridge]
Can't you hear us coming?
People marching all around
Can't you see me coming?
Close your eyes, it's over now

Can't you see we're coming?
Can't you see we're coming?

Got your freedom now, boy, who do you serve?
Took for granted what you should have preserved
No time left, no time left to make amends
Keep burning bridges while you're buying your new friends

A day of reflection hits, you're a shell
Skin and bones, counting costs
Is it worth your soul?

The pain fade away
So important then, doesn't matter now
Both feet on the ground
Come full circle, yeah

Jump the fence to see what's on the other side

[Verse 1]
When dreaming, I'm guided to another world
Time and time again
At sunrise, I fight to stay asleep
'Cause I don't wanna leave the comfort of this place
'Cause there's a hunger, a longing to escape
From the life I live when I'm awake
[Pre-Chorus]
So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask, ""Can we stay?""
[Chorus]
Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?
[Verse 2]
Although I would like our world to change
It helps me to appreciate
Those nights and those dreams
But, my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights
If I could make the Earth and my dreams the same
The only difference is to let love replace all our hate

They never healed the cuts

I wanna be in your arms again

Who'd knew I'd be the one who still can't let go
And now I think I know
What it's like to lose control

Since the day you died
I can see your face
In the rain at night

In the rain, I sing to you

My Own Prison,Original,"
[Verse 1: Scott Stapp]
Court is in session
A verdict is in
No appeal on the docket today
Just my own sin
The walls, cold and pale
The cage, made of steel
Screams fill the room
Alone, I drop and kneel
Silence, now the sound
My breath, the only motion around
Demons cluttering around
My face, showing no emotion
Shackled by my sentence
Expecting no return
Here, there is no penance
My skin begins to burn
[Chorus: Scott Stapp,
Mark Tremonti
]
(And I said, ""Ohhhhhhh"")
So I held my head up high
Hiding hate that burns inside
Which only fuels their selfish pride
(And I said, ""Ohhhhhhh"")
All held captive out from the sun
A sun that shines on only some
We, the meek, are all in one
[Verse 2: Scott Stapp]
I hear a thunder in the distance
See a vision of a cross
I feel the pain that was given
On that sad day of loss
A lion roars in the darkness
Only he holds the key
A light to free me from my burden
And grant me life eternally
[Pre-Chorus: Scott Stapp]
Should have been dead
On a Sunday morning
Banging my head
No time for mourning
Ain't got no time
Should have been dead
On a Sunday morning
Banging my head
No time for mourning
Ain't got no time

We, the meek, are all in one
[Bridge: Scott Stapp]

Seeking only His decision

Never Die,Original,"

Watching some children laugh and play
They're running in circles
With candy canes and French braids
Inspired to question
What makes us grown-ups anyway?
Let's search for the moment
When youth betrayed itself to age
[Chorus]
So let the children play
Inside your heart always
And death you will defy
'Cause your youth will never die
Never die
[Verse 2]
In searching for substance
We're clouded by struggle's haze
Remember the meaning
Of playing out in the rain
We swim in the fountain
Of youth's timeless maze
If you drink the water
Your youth will never fade
[Chorus]
So let the children play
Inside your heart always
And death you will defy
'Cause your youth will never die

Covered by summer rain
Losing all my reason
'Cause there's nothing left to blame

It's safe to say that I'm stuck again
Trapped between this life and the light

Or compromise

Pieces of me I have lost
Without any choice I move on
Hey time, you're no friend of mine
Hey time, you're no friend of mine

You cover yourself like you cover your sins
Please untie my hands, I'm a sinner, I'm a man

Wash Away The Years,Original,"
She came calling one early morning
She showed her crown of thorns
She whispered softly to tell a story
About how she had been wronged
As she lay lifeless
He stole her innocence
And this is how she carried on
This is how she carried on
Well, I guess she closed her eyes
And just imagined everything's alright
But she could not hide her tears
'Cause they were sent to wash away those years
They were sent to wash away those years
My anger's violent but still I'm silent
When tragedy strikes at home
I know this decadence is shared by millions
Remember you're not alone
Remember you're not alone
Well, if you just close your eyes
And just imagine everything's alright

Weathered,Original,"
[Verse 1]
I lie awake on a long, dark night
I can't seem to tame my mind
Slings and arrows are killing me inside
Maybe I can't accept the life that's mine, no
Maybe I can't accept the life that's mine
[Verse 2]
Simple living is my desperate cry
Been trading love with indifference
And yeah, it suits me just fine
I try to hold on but I'm calloused to the bone
Maybe that's why I feel alone, yeah
Maybe that's why I feel so alone

'Cause me, I'm rusted and weathered
Barely holding together
I'm covered with skin that peels

Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Sometimes I feel like giving up, yeah

The night hides your truth
The earth is a voice

But I choose to win
I choose to fight
To fight

What If,Original,"
[Verse 1]
I can't find the rhyme in all my reason
Lost sense of time and all seasons
Feel I've been beaten down
By the words of men who have no grounds
Can't sleep beneath the trees of wisdom
When your ax has cut the roots that feed them
Forked tongues in bitter mouths
Can drive a man to bleed from inside out
[Chorus]
What if you did?
What if you lied?
What if I avenge?
What if eye for an eye?
[Verse 2]
I've seen the wicked fruit of your vine
Destroy the man who lacks a strong mind
Human pride sings a vengeful song
Inspired by the times you've been walked on
My stage is shared by many millions
Who lift their hands up high because they feel this
We are one, we are strong
The more you hold us down, the more we press on
[Chorus]
What if you did?
What if you lied?
What if I avenge?
What if eye for an eye?
[Bridge]
I know I can't hold my hate inside my mind
Because what consumes your thoughts controls your life
So I'll just ask a question, a lonely, simple question
I'll just ask one question
What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?
What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?
What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?
What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?
[Chorus]
What if you did?
What if you lied?
What if I avenge?
What if eye for an eye?
What if your words
Could be judged like a crime?

Hurray for a child that makes it through
If there's any way because
The answer lies in you
They're laid to rest before
They've known just what to do
Their souls are lost because
They could never find

You see my heart, you look away
You see my wrist, I know your pain
I know your purpose on your plane

Who’s Got My Back,Original,"

Run, hide
All that was sacred to us, sacred to us
See the signs
The covenant has been broken by mankind
Leaving us with no shoulder, with no shoulder
[Pre-Chorus]
To rest our head on
To rest our head on
To rest our head on
[Chorus]
Who's got my back now
When all we have left is deceptive?
So disconnected
What is the truth now?
[Post-Chorus]
(What is the truth now?)
[Verse 2]
There's still time
All that has been devastated can be recreated
Realize
We pick up the broken pieces of our lives
Giving ourselves to each other, ourselves to each other
[Pre-Chorus]
To rest our head on
To rest our head on
To rest our head on
[Chorus]
Who's got my back now
When all we have left is deceptive?
So disconnected

Young Grow Old,Original,"
[Verse 1]
He said he's falling to pieces
Fighting the boy and the man
Over his shoulder there was freedom
But consciousness has tied his hands
Embodied youth was his distinction
Now inhibition's in demand
So driven by his fear of weakness
But that's his key to understand
[Chorus]
So far in a distant land
There's a fight between boy and man
See the light through the open door
Sit and watch as the young grow old
[Verse 2]
Trading places in the circle
Turn the glass, spill the sand
They say that time can make a difference
But age doesn't make you a man
[Chorus]
So far in a distant land
There's a fight between boy and man
See the light through the open door
Sit and watch as the young grow old

So young, but overblown
So young, but overblown (So young, but overblown)

Watch him fade, watch him fade away
Take a bow and the boy is defeated
Is this the way, this the way?
