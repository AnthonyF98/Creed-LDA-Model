Allusion (Blue Collar Records)

[Verse 1]
The sun rises to another day
My constitution keeps changing till it slips away
So I lie awake and stare
My mind thinking, just wondering does anybody care
[Chorus]
Should I stay or go?
Should I sleep or stay awake?
Am I really happy or is it all
Just an allusion?
[Verse 2]
Sitting in my room now
Hiding thoughts, just hoping one day I'll get out
I hear a voice call my name
Breaking trance so silent, so I can stay the same
[Chorus]
Should I stay or go?
Should I sleep or stay awake?
Am I really happy or is it all
Just an allusion?
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
Wait now, many things are left unsaid
This life remains the same but I change
I try to fool myself in believing
Things are gonna get better, but life goes on
[Chorus]
Should I stay or go?
Should I sleep or stay awake?
Am I really happy or is it all
Just an allusion?
[Outro]
Just an allusion
Just an allusion
Just an allusion
Just an allusion
Just an allusion
Just an allusion
Just an allusion

A Thousand Faces

[Verse 1]
I stand surrounded by the walls that once confined me
Knowing I'll be underneath them
When they crumble when they fall
With clarity my scars remind me
Ash still simmers just under my skin
[Pre-Chorus]
Difference smiles again
So much I hide
How is stepping back a move forward?
[Chorus]
Now I'm forced to look behind
I'm forced to look at you
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell me which is you
Broken mirrors paint the floor
Why can't you see the truth
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell me which is you
Tell me which is you
[Verse 2]
Eerily time made no change
Pointing fingers, laying blame
Lying over and over and over and over
Deceiving your mind
Dug my grave, trash my name
Yet here I stand so you won't fade away
[Pre-Chorus]
Difference smiles again
So much I hide
How is stepping back a move forward?
[Chorus]
Now I'm forced to look behind
I'm forced to look at you
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell me which is you
Broken mirrors paint the floor
Why can't you see the truth
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell me which is you
Tell me which is you
[Bridge]
I bleed inside
Just let it out
Just let it out
I bleed inside
Just let it out
I'm going to let it out
Just let it out
Just let it out
Let it die
[Chorus]
Now I'm forced to look behind
I'm forced to look at you
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell me which is you
Broken mirrors paint the floor
Why can't you see the truth
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell me which is you
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me which is you
[Outro]
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me which is you
Tell me which is you

Away in Silence

[Verse 1]
You walked away in silence, you walked away to breathe
Stopped and turned around to say goodbye to me
I'm pleading as you're leaving, I'm begging you to stay
I'm not the man I used to be, I've changed
I'm not the man I used to be, I've changed
[Chorus]
Don't give up on us, don't give up on love
Don't give up on us, don't give up on love
If my life is the price, then my life it will cost
Now that I'm picking up the pieces, see the pain that I have caused
It's hard to believe in someone you thought was lost
Don't give up on us, don't give up on love
Don't you walk away in silence
[Verse 2]
In tears you counted reasons, tears covered you it seemed
Face down screaming "God, help me please"
I'm pleading as you're leaving, I'm begging you to stay
I'm not the man I used to be, I've changed
I'm not the man I used to be, I've changed
[Chorus]
Don't give up on us, don't give up on love
Don't give up on us, don't give up on love
If my life is the price, then my life it will cost
Now that I'm picking up the pieces, see the pain that I have caused
It's hard to believe in someone you thought was lost
Don't give up on us, don't give up on love
Don't you walk away in silence, please come back to me
Don't you walk away in silence, I'm not the man I used to be
[Bridge]
(Well I pray that tomorrow you'll be home)
We can rebuild and forever, we can go on, go on, and go on
We can go on
(Well I pray that tomorrow you'll be home)
Look at horizons and let the light bring you home, home
Bring you home
[Outro]
Don't give up on us, don't give up on love
Don't give up on us, don't give up on love
If my life is the price, then my life it will cost
Now that I'm picking up the pieces, see the pain that I have caused
It's hard to believe in someone you thought was lost
Don't give up on us, don't give up on love
Don't walk away in silence, please don't walk away
Don't walk away in silence, I'm not the man I used to be

Beautiful

[Verse 1]
She wears a coat of color
Loved by some, feared by others
She's immortalized
In young men's eyes
[Verse 2]
Lust she breeds in the eyes of brothers
Violent sons make bitter mothers
So close your eyes
Here's your surprise
[Chorus]
But, beautiful is empty
Beautiful is free
Beautiful loves no one
Beautiful stripped me
Stripped me
Stripped me
She stripped me
[Verse 3]
In your mind, she's your companion
Vile instincts often candid
Your regret
Is all that's left
[Chorus]
But, beautiful is empty
Beautiful is free
Beautiful loves no one
Beautiful stripped me
Stripped me
Stripped me
She stripped me
[Bridge]
She told me where I'm going
And it's far away from home
I think I'll go there on my own
I think I'll go there on my own
She told me where I'm going
And it's far away from home
I think I'll go there on my own
I think I'll go there on my own
[Chorus]
But, beautiful is empty
Beautiful is free
Beautiful loves no one
Beautiful stripped me
Stripped me
Stripped me
She stripped me
She stripped me
Stripped me

Blistered (Demo)

[Verse 1]
Two steps closer
A thousand steps away
Wait to the system
Until I know other way
My hands blistered
But now numb to the pain
My mind twisted
In this cruel democracy
[Refrain]
But now I'm free
Now I'm free
[Verse 2]
Feels like a thousand years
Taken from me
Choose my priorities
But they're shoved
In my face
My destiny in life
So far away
So far away
[Refrain]
But now I'm free
Now I'm free
[Chorus]
Oh, I guess it was a good ride
But looking back I feel the same
I guess it was a last time, no regrets
Who's to blame?
Show me how to live my life now
Very different from my own
A simple explanation
Further from the torn hole
I'm leaving now
I said I'm leaving now
I said I'm leaving now
And I got no place to go
[Bridge]
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
I said I'm leaving now
I said I'm leaving now
I said I'm leaving now
And I got no place to go
[Outro]
But now I'm free
Now I'm free
Now I'm free, yeah
Now I'm free, yeah

Bound and Tied

[Verse 1]
Tongue-tied, restless, and wanting
Looks like you might bite, you might bite
Breathing in, breathing out, you're weakened
The poison's hit your mind, your mind
Time's ticking and its got you thinking
You're happy with your life, your life
You're jaded, slated and singled out
By all those chains that bind, that bind
[Chorus]
Take a jet plane my way lately
Because now you are mine, you are mine
This airplane's going my way
'Cause now you're bound and tied
You're bound and tied
You're bound and tied
[Verse 2]
Now sit and reflect on all the fame
Time to dim your light, your light
Zooming in, zooming out, you're questioning
For that there is no crime, no crime
You're cheated, slated and singled out
By all those chains they bind, they bind
[Chorus]
Take a jet plane my way lately
Because now you are mine, you are mine
This airplane's going my way
'Cause now you're bound and tied
You're bound and tied
You're bound and tied
[Bridge]
And we fly, we fly, we fly
And we fly, we fly, we fly
And we fly, and we fly (Fly, fly, fly, fly)
[Outro]
Bound and tied
You're bound and tied
Bound and tied
You're bound and tied
Bound and tied
You're bound and tied
You're bound and tied

Bread of Shame

[Verse 1]
If you say I'm alive I guess I'm living
Why should I exercise a choice I've been given
Tell me everything's fine and peace is coming
I won't listen to the heartache I'm numbing
[Pre-Chorus]
When the world casts me down and says I've changed
I'll survive on all the promises you made to me
Guess there's no one to blame
When all you're living on is bread of shame
[Chorus]
Bread of shame
When the world says I've changed
Bread of shame
Just promise me fame I'll survive on the bread of shame
[Verse 2]
As long as you say I'm free, then keep these chains on me
Tell me down is up, I'll let you fill this broken cup
When the walls fall down, let them fall on me
'Cause no one's around who believes me
[Pre-Chorus]
When the world casts me down and says I've changed
I'll survive on all the promises you made to me
Guess there's no one to blame
When all you're living on is bread of shame
[Chorus]
Bread of shame
When the world says I've changed
Bread of shame
Just promise me fame I'll survive on the bread of shame
[Bridge]
Tell me where I sign my name (Tell me where I sign my name)
Inside I find no peace of mind to hide behind
Only bread of shame
Tell me where I sign my name (Tell me where I sign my name)
Inside I have no peace of mind
Only bread of shame
[Chorus]
Bread of shame
When the world says I've changed
Bread of shame
Just promise me fame I'll survive on the bread of shame

Bullets

[Intro]
Walking around I hear the sounds of the earth seeking relief
I'm trying to find a reason to live
But the mindless clutter my path
Oh, these thorns in my side
Oh, these thorns in my side
I know I have something free
I have something so alive
I think they shoot 'cause they want it
I think they shoot 'cause they want it
I think they shoot 'cause they want it!
[Verse 1]
I feel forces all around me
Come on, raise your head
Those who hide behind the shadows
Live with all that's dead
[Chorus]
Look at me! Look at me! Look at me!
At least look at me when you shoot a bullet through my head
Through my head, through my head
[Verse 2]
In my lifetime when I'm disgraced
Jealousy and lies
I laugh aloud 'cause my life
Has gotten inside someone else's mind
[Chorus]
Look at me! Look at me! Look at me!
At least look at me when you shoot a bullet through my head
Through my head, through my head
Yeah
[Bridge]
Hey, all I want is what's real
Something I touch and can feel
I'll hold it close and never let it go
Said why, why do we live this life
With all this hate inside?
I'll give it away 'cause I don't want it no more
Please, help me find a place
Somewhere far away
Yes, I'll go and you'll never see me again
[Chorus]
Look at me! Look at me!
At least look at me when you shoot a bullet through my head
Through my head, through my head
Look at me! Look at me!
At least look at me when you shoot a bullet through my head
Through my head, through my head
[Outro]
Look at me!
Look at me!

Don’t Stop Dancing

[Verse 1]
At times life is wicked
And I just can't see the light
A silver lining sometimes isn't enough
To make some wrongs seem right
[Refrain]
Whatever life brings
I've been through everything
And now I'm on my knees again
[Pre-Chorus]
But I know, I must go on
Although I hurt, I must be strong
Because inside, I know
That many feel this way
[Chorus]
Children, don't stop dancing
Believe you can fly away, away
[Verse 2]
At times life's unfair
And you know it's plain to see
Hey, God, I know I'm just a dot in this world
Have You forgot about me?
[Refrain]
Whatever life brings
I've been through everything
And now I'm on my knees again
[Pre-Chorus]
But I know, I must go on
Although I hurt, I must be strong
Because inside, I know
That many feel this way
[Chorus]
Children, don't stop dancing
Believe you can fly away, away
[Bridge]
Am I hiding in the shadows?
Forget the pain and forget the sorrows
Am I hiding in the shadows?
Forget the pain and forget the sorrows
[Pre-Chorus]
But I know, I must go on
Although I hurt, I must be strong
Because inside, I know
That many feel this way
[Chorus]
Children, don't stop dancing
Believe you can fly away, away
Children, don't stop dancing
Believe you can fly away, away
Children, don't stop dancing
Believe you can fly away, away
[Outro]
Am I hiding in the shadows?
Are we hiding in the shadows?

Faceless Man

[Verse 1]
I spent a day by the river
It was quiet and the wind stood still
I spent some time with nature
To remind me of all that's real
It's funny how silence speaks sometimes when you're alone
And remember that you feel
I said it's funny how silence speaks sometimes when you're alone
And remember that you feel
[Chorus]
Again I stand, Lord, I stand
Against the faceless man
Again I stand, Lord, I stand
Against the faceless man
[Verse 2]
Now I saw a face on the water
It looked humble but willing to fight
I saw the will of a warrior
His yoke is easy and his burden is light
He looked me right in the eyes, direct and concise to remind me
To always do what's right
He looked me right in the eyes, direct and concise to remind me
To always do what's right
[Chorus]
Again I stand, Lord, I stand
Against the faceless man
Again I stand, Lord God, I stand
Against the faceless man
[Verse 3]
Because if the face inside can't see the light, I know
I'll have to walk alone
And if I walk alone to the other side, I know
I might not make it home
[Chorus]
Again I stand, Lord, I stand
Against the faceless man
Again I stand, Lord, I stand
Against the faceless man
[Bridge]
Next time I see this face, I'll say
I choose to live for always
So won't you come inside
And never go away?
Next time I see this face, I'll say
I choose to live for always
So won't you come inside
And never go away?
[Chorus]
Again I stand, Lord, I stand
Against the faceless man
Again I stand, Lord, I stand
Against the faceless man
Again I stand, Lord, I stand
Against the faceless man

Next time I see this face, I'll say
I choose to live for always
So won't you come inside
And never go away?
Next time I see this face, I'll say
I choose to live for always
So won't you come inside
And never go away?
[Chorus]
Again I stand, Lord, I stand
Against the faceless man
Again I stand, Lord, I stand
Against the faceless man
Again I stand, Lord, I stand
Against the faceless man

Fear

[Verse 1]
The cradle of civilization sparks my fascination
Truth ignites our generation to change what's been programmed
Inside the mind
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you turn a blind eye
Change what's been programmed inside
Don't you turn a blind eye
[Chorus]
Listen to me when I tell you
Feel the passion in my breath
Stay on top if they let you
Because the change is permanent
Change is permanent
[Verse 2]
Rudiments of interpersonal communication
Truth will uproot and bring war's devastation to light
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you turn a blind eye
Change what's been programmed inside
Staying silent is a crime
[Chorus]
Listen to me when I tell you
Feel the passion in my breath
Stay on top if they let you
Because the change is permanent
Change is permanent
[Bridge]
Change starts in your mind
Leave the past behind
Forget everything you know
Make a change, let go
Change starts in your mind
Leave the past behind
Forget everything you know
Make a change, let go
Change starts in your mind
Leave the past behind
Forget everything you know
Make a change, let go
Let go, let go, let go, let go
[Chorus]
Listen to me when I tell you
Feel the passion in my breath
Stay on top if they let you
Because the change is permanent
Listen to me when I tell you
Feel the passion in my breath
Stay on top if they let you
Because the change is permanent
Change is permanent
[Outro]
Leave the past behind
Leave the past behind
Make a change, let go
Let go, let go, let go, let go, let go

Freedom Fighter

[Verse 1]
The mouths of envious always find another door
While at the gates of paradise they beat us down some more
Our mission's set in stone because the writing's on the wall
I'll scream it from the mountain tops pride comes before a fall
[Verse 2]
So many thoughts to share, all this energy to give
Unlike those who hide the truth, I tell it like it is
If the truth will set you free I feel sorry for your soul
Can't you hear the ringing? 'Cause for you the bell tolls
[Chorus]
I'm just a freedom fighter, no remorse
Raging on in holy war
Soon there'll come a day
When you're face to face with me
Face to face with me
Face to face with me
Face to face with me
[Bridge]
Can't you hear us coming?
People marching all around
Can't you see me coming?
Close your eyes, it's over now
Can't you hear us coming?
The fight has only just begun
Can't you see we're coming?
Can't you see we're coming?
Can't you see we're coming?
Can't you hear us coming?
[Chorus]
I'm just a freedom fighter, no remorse
Raging on in holy war
Soon there'll come a day
When you're face to face with me
Freedom fighter, no remorse
Raging on in holy war
Soon there'll come a day
When you're face to face to
Face to face to face to face with me

========================================

Full Circle

[Verse 1]
Got your freedom now, boy, who do you serve?
Took for granted what you should have preserved
No time left, no time left to make amends
Keep burning bridges while you're buying your new friends
[Pre-Chorus]
A day of reflection hits, you're a shell
Skin and bones, counting costs
Is it worth your soul?
A day of reflection hits
[Chorus]
It's funny how times can change
Rearrange and distance makes
The pain fade away
So important then, doesn't matter now
Both feet on the ground
Come full circle, yeah
Come full circle
[Verse 2]
No access granted now, boy, you've been denied
Jump the fence to see what's on the other side
Are you wanted, are you wanted? The question is
Could second chances mean another impression?
[Pre-Chorus]
A day of reflection hits, you're a shell
Skin and bones, counting costs
Is it worth your soul?
A day of reflection hits
[Chorus]
It's funny how times can change
Rearrange and distance makes
The pain fade away
So important then, doesn't matter now
Both feet on the ground
Come full circle
We come full circle
[Bridge]
I got one foot stuck in heaven, yeah, one boot stuck in hell
I looked at God, he winked at me, I made this mess myself
Don't be surprised and don't deny, hear every word I say
Close the door and don't look back or you will fade away
[Chorus]
It's funny how times can change
Rearrange and distance makes
The pain fade away
It's funny how times can change
Rearrange and distance makes
The pain fade away
So important then, doesn't matter now
Both feet on the ground
Come full circle
[Guitar Solo]
[Outro]
Full circle
Come full circle
We have come
Full circle

Good Fight

[Verse 1]
I give my all my everything
Anything you want I've tried to be
I try, God knows I try
Or am I stuck somewhere between
Who I am and who I hope to be?
Am I fighting the good fight
[Chorus]
Keep pressing on
Fight the good fight
Fight, what you know is wrong
Keep pressing on
Fight the good fight
Fight, what you know is wrong
[Verse 2]
I've come so far to fall too fast
Eyes forward, I can't look back
Why try? God knows I try
I shift my eyes to the sky
In the distance see the horizon line
She waits for me, fighting the good fight
[Chorus]
Keep pressing on
Fight the good fight
Fight, what you know is wrong
Keep pressing on
Fight the good fight
Fight, what you know is wrong
[Verse 3]
I give my all, my everything
Anything you want I strive to be
Am I stuck somewhere between
Who I am and who I hope to be? (What you know is wrong)
Fighting, I'm fighting
Fighting the good fight (What you know is wrong)
Am I stuck somewhere in between
Who I am and who I hope to be
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Keep pressing on
Fight the good fight
Fight, what you know is wrong
Keep pressing on
Fight the good fight
Fight, what you know is wrong
[Outro]
Remember that sometimes I fall in between
The nights blue moon and the shadows it keeps
Fight on, fight the good fight (What you know is wrong)
And I'll keep fighting the good fight (And I'll keep fighting)
Press on and fight (What you know is wrong)
Fight the good fight, fight on (Press on and fight)
Keep fighting the good fight
Fight on, fight on
Fight on
Keep fighting the good fight
Fight on, fight on

Good Weather

[그리즐리 "Good Weather" 가사]
[Verse 1]
네 무릎에 걸터앉아 have a good morning to my puppies
따뜻한 티 상쾌한 아침
부터 다시 맞은 눈빛
꽃병에 물은 내가 줄게
넌 간단한 요리 준비해 줄래
내가 앞치마 둘러줄게
또 보고 놀래 너의 허리둘레
땋아올린 머리 pony tale
[Pre-Chorus]
날씨가 좋아서 널 가만둘 수가 없어
(You don’t need to take a shower, 가져다줄게, my flower)
날씨가 좋아서 커튼을 젖혔어, oh yeah
(약간의 빛만 들어오게끔, yeah, running out is an hour)
[Chorus]
Oh good weather, my flower
어제보다 더 뜨겁게, 널 사랑할게 나
Oh good weather, my flower
어제보다 더 뜨겁게, 널 아껴줄게 나
[Verse 2]
오후가 되면 저기
한강 근처에 다녀올까
Or 집에서 영화나 볼까
아님 같이 누워서 시시콜콜
일상적인 대화를 나눌까
사실 우린 이미 영화 속 주인공
넌 신데렐라 난 널 지키는 손오공
너와 함께면 삶의 의미가 생겨
네 예쁜 미소는 덤
[Pre-Chorus]
날씨가 좋아서 널 가만둘 수가 없어
(You don’t need to take a shower, 가져다줄게, my flower)
날씨가 좋아서 커튼을 젖혔어, oh yeah
(약간의 빛만 들어오게끔, yeah, running out is an hour)

Oh good weather, my flower
어제보다 더 뜨겁게, 널 사랑할게 나
Oh good weather, my flower
어제보다 더 뜨겁게, 널 아껴줄게 나

Hide

[Verse 1]
To what do I owe this gift, my friend?
My life, my love, my soul?
I've been dancing with the devil way too long
And it's making me grow old
Making me grow old, yeah
[Chorus]
Let's leave, oh, let's get away
Get lost in time
Where there's no reason left to hide, yeah
Let's leave, oh, let's get away
Run in fields of time
Where there's no reason left to hide
No reason left to hide
[Verse 2]
What you're going to do with your gift, dear child?
Give life, give love, give soul
Divided is the one who dances
For the soul is so exposed
So exposed
[Chorus]
Let's leave, oh, let's get away
Get lost in time
Where there's no reason left to hide, yeah
Let's leave, oh, let's get away

Let's leave all this and get away
Get lost in time

Higher

[Verse 1]
When dreaming, I'm guided to another world
Time and time again
At sunrise, I fight to stay asleep
'Cause I don't wanna leave the comfort of this place
'Cause there's a hunger, a longing to escape
From the life I live when I'm awake
[Pre-Chorus]
So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask, "Can we stay?"
[Chorus]
Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?
[Verse 2]
Although I would like our world to change
It helps me to appreciate
Those nights and those dreams
But, my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights
If I could make the Earth and my dreams the same
The only difference is to let love replace all our hate
[Pre-Chorus]
So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask, "Can we stay?"
[Chorus]
Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher

Come on, let's go there (Go, go there)

Up high, I feel like I'm alive for the very first time
Sail up high, I'm strong enough
To take these dreams and make them mine
Sail up high, I'm strong enough
To take these dreams and make them mine
[Chorus]
Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?
Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?

Illusion

[Verse 1]
The sun rises to another day
My constitution keeps changing 'til it slips away
So I lie awake and stare
My mind thinking, just wondering does anybody care?
[Chorus]
Should I stay or go?
Should I sleep or stay awake?
Am I really happy or is it all
Just an illusion?
[Verse 2]
Sitting in my room now
Hiding thoughts, just hoping one day I'll get out
I hear a voice call my name
Breaking trance so silent, so I can stay the same
[Chorus]
Should I stay or go?
Should I sleep or stay awake?
Am I really happy or is it all
Just an illusion?
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
Wait now, many things are left unsaid
This life remains the same but I change
I try to fool myself in believing
Things are going to get better but life goes on

Should I sleep or stay awake?
Am I really happy or is it all
Just an illusion?

Lines form on my face and hands
Lines form from the ups and downs
I'm in the middle without any plan
I'm a boy and I'm a man
[Chorus]
I'm eighteen and I don't know what I want
Eighteen, I just don't know what I want
Eighteen, I gotta get away
I've gotta get out of this place
I'll go running in outer space, oh yeah
[Verse 2]
I've got a baby's brain and an old man's heart
Took eighteen years to get this far
Don't always know what I'm talking about
Feels like I'm living in the middle of doubt
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm eighteen, I get confused every day
Eighteen, I just don't know what to say
Eighteen, I gotta get away
[Verse 3]
Oh, lines form on my face and my hands
Lines form on the left and right
I'm in the middle, the middle of life
I'm a boy and I'm a man

I'm eighteen and I like it
Yes, I like it
Well, I like it, love it, like it, love it
Eighteen, eighteen, eighteen

I've gotta get out of this place
I'll go running in outer space, oh yeah
[Verse 2]
I've got a baby's brain and an old man's heart
Took eighteen years to get this far
Don't always know what I'm talking about
Feels like I'm living in the middle of doubt
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm eighteen, I get confused every day
Eighteen, I just don't know what to say
Eighteen, I gotta get away
[Verse 3]
Oh, lines form on my face and my hands
Lines form on the left and right
I'm in the middle, the middle of life
I'm a boy and I'm a man
[Outro]
I'm eighteen and I like it
Yes, I like it
Well, I like it, love it, like it, love it
Eighteen, eighteen, eighteen
I'm eighteen and I like it

Only in America
We're slaves to be free
Only in America we kill the unborn
To make ends meet
Only in America
Sexuality is democracy
Only in America we stamp our God
“In God We Trust”

What is right or wrong
I don't know who to believe in
My soul sings a different song
In America

In America, In America, In America

Church bells ringing
Pass the plate around
The choir is singing
As their leader falls to the ground
Please mister prophet man
Tell me which way to go
I gave my last dollar
Can I still come to your show

What is right or wrong
I don't know who to believe in

Inside Us All

[Verse 1]
When I'm all alone
And no one else is there
Waiting by the phone
To remind me I'm still here
When shadows paint the scenes
Where spotlights used to fall
And I'm left wondering
Is it really worth it all?
[Chorus]
There's a peace inside us all
Let it be your friend
It will help you carry on
In the end
There's a peace inside us all
[Verse 2]
Life can hold you down
When you're not looking up
Can't you hear the sounds?
Hearts beating out loud
Although the names change
Inside we're all the same
Why can't we tear down the walls?
And show the scars we're covering
[Chorus]
There's a peace inside us all
Let it be your friend
It will help you carry on
In the end
There's a peace inside us all
[Bridge]
There's a peace, oh, there's a peace inside us all
Let it be, oh, I said, let it be
Let it be your friend
[Chorus]
There's a peace inside us all
Let it be your friend
It will help you carry on
In the end
There's a peace inside us all

There's a peace, inside us all, inside us all
(There's a peace inside us all)
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be
(There's a peace inside us all)
Let it be your friend
(There's a peace inside us all)

In The Rain

Its been some years now
Did a lot of drugs
They never healed the cuts
I wanna feel your love
I wanna be in your arms again
There's no hope left for us
This is the end of all we know
I was so quick to let you go
Who'd knew I'd be the one who still can't let go
And now I think I know
What it's like to lose control
I haven't felt the good light
Since the day you died
I can see your face
In the rain at night
In the rain at night
In the rain at night
In the rain, I sing to you
I cry

========================================

Is This the End?

[Verse 1]
The rage in my eyes could have compared to the eye of the sun
Then rain took it's course through the hands of the son
Revenge for all time, the world is at war, leaving all hope behind
[Chorus]
So, is this the end for us, my friend?
So, is this the end for us, my friend?
[Verse 2]
The stains in the sky are there to remind us of man and his pride
When two worlds collide, one steals the life like a thief in the night
So look to the sky, he holds the keys for your life and mine
[Chorus]
So, is this the end for us, my friend?
So, is this the end for us, my friend?
So, is this the end for us, my friend?
[Bridge]
Well, as though we rise
As the day breaks the dawn
And as the moon hides the sun
Oh, the sun
No more sorrow
All those crying days are gone
No more sorrow, now it's gone
Now it's gone
Now it's gone
[Chorus]
So, is this the end for us, my friend?
So, is this the end for us, my friend?
So, is this the end for us, my friend?
So, is this the end for us, my friend?
So, is this the end for us, my friend?

Is This The End? (Acoustic Version)

The rage in my eyes
Could have compared to the eye of the sun
Then rage Took it's course through the hands of the son
Revenge for all time
The world is at war leaving all fault behind
And I ask so
Is this the end
For us my friend
So, is this the end
For us my friend
The stains on his side
Cover the sins of mankind and his pride
That night, he died
But rose once again to sit down by his side
He reigns for all time
Taking the keys back for your life
And mine
And I ask so
Is this the end for us my friend
So, is this the end for us my friend
So, is this the end for us my friend, oh yeah
But as the wind rides
As the day breaks the dawn
And as the moon hides the sun, oh the sun
No more sorrow, oh your crying days are gone
No more sorrow, now its gone, now its gone
They're gone
They're gone
They're gone
And I ask so
Is this the end for us my friend
So, is this the end for us my friend
So, is this the end for us my friend
So, is this the end for us my friend

More Than This (Demo)

[Verse 1]
One more time and I will go (and I will go)
It seems that we always assume it's right
I choose to wait and find
Whenever truth is not enough (is not enough)
We're seeking time to break free from lorn
I guess we're too far gone
[Verse 2]
Seems it's right to finally start (to finally start)
Change all the lines that held us down
We'll try to gain new ground
When living in peace is not enough (is not enough)
Look at the tides that made us strong
I guess we're too far gone
[Instrumental Outro]

My Own Prison

[Verse 1: Scott Stapp]
Court is in session
A verdict is in
No appeal on the docket today
Just my own sin
The walls, cold and pale
The cage, made of steel
Screams fill the room
Alone, I drop and kneel
Silence, now the sound
My breath, the only motion around
Demons cluttering around
My face, showing no emotion
Shackled by my sentence
Expecting no return
Here, there is no penance
My skin begins to burn
[Chorus: Scott Stapp, 
Mark Tremonti
]
(And I said, "Ohhhhhhh")
So I held my head up high
Hiding hate that burns inside
Which only fuels their selfish pride
(And I said, "Ohhhhhhh")
All held captive out from the sun
A sun that shines on only some
We, the meek, are all in one
[Verse 2: Scott Stapp]
I hear a thunder in the distance
See a vision of a cross
I feel the pain that was given
On that sad day of loss
A lion roars in the darkness
Only he holds the key
A light to free me from my burden
And grant me life eternally
[Pre-Chorus: Scott Stapp]
Should have been dead
On a Sunday morning
Banging my head
No time for mourning
Ain't got no time
Should have been dead
On a Sunday morning
Banging my head
No time for mourning
Ain't got no time
[Chorus: Scott Stapp, 
Mark Tremonti

(And I said, "Ohhhhhhh")
So I held my head up high
Hiding hate that burns inside
Which only fuels their selfish pride
(And I said, "Ohhhhhhh")
All held captive out from the sun
A sun that shines on only some
We, the meek, are all in one
[Bridge: Scott Stapp]
I cry out to God
Seeking only His decision
Gabriel
 stands and confirms
I've created my own prison
I cry out to God
Seeking only His decision
Gabriel stands and confirms
I've created my own prison
[Chorus: Scott Stapp,

Hiding hate that burns inside
Which only fuels their selfish pride
(And I said, "Ohhhhhhh")
All held captive out from the sun
A sun that shines on only some
We, the meek, are all in one
(And I said, "Ohhhhhhh")
So I held my head up high
Hiding hate that burns inside
Which only fuels their selfish pride
(And I said, "Ohhhhhhh") (I created, I created, I created)
All held captive out from the sun
A sun that shines on only some
 (I created, I created)
We, the meek, are all in one

I cry out to God, seeking only His decision
Gabriel stands and confirms, I've created my own prison

So, I held my head up high
Hiding hate that burns inside
 (Oh-oh)
Which only fuels their selfish pride
 (Oh, yeah)
(And I said, oh) 
We're all held captive out from the sun
A sun that shines on only some
 (Oh-oh)
We, the meek, are all in one
 (Oh, yeah)

So, I held my head up high
Hiding hate that burns inside

My Sacrifice

[Verse 1]
Hello my friend, we meet again
It's been a while, where should we begin?
Feels like forever
Within my heart are memories
Of perfect love that you gave to me
Oh, I remember
[Chorus]
When you are with me, I'm free
I'm careless, 
I believe
Above all the others, we'll fly
This brings tears to my eyes
My sacrifice
[Verse 2]
We've seen our share of ups and downs
Oh, how quickly life can turn around
In an instant
It feels so good to reunite
Within yourself and within your mind
Let's find peace there
[Chorus]
'Cause when you are with me, I'm free
I'm careless, I believe
Above all the others, we'll fly
This brings tears to my eyes
My sacrifice
[Bridge]
I just want to say hello again
I just want to say hello again
[Chorus]
'Cause when you are with me, I'm free
I'm careless, I believe
Above all the others, we'll fly
This brings tears to my eyes
'Cause when you are with me, I'm free
I'm careless, I believe
Above all the others, we'll fly
This brings tears to my eyes
My sacrifice
My sacrifice
[Outro]
I just want to say hello again
I just want to say hello again

Never Die

[Verse 1]
Hands on a window pane
Watching some children laugh and play
They're running in circles
With candy canes and French braids
Inspired to question
What makes us grown-ups anyway?
Let's search for the moment
When youth betrayed itself to age
[Chorus]
So let the children play
Inside your heart always
And death you will defy
'Cause your youth will never die
Never die
[Verse 2]
In searching for substance
We're clouded by struggle's haze
Remember the meaning
Of playing out in the rain
We swim in the fountain
Of youth's timeless maze
If you drink the water
Your youth will never fade
[Chorus]
So let the children play
Inside your heart always
And death you will defy
'Cause your youth will never die
Never die
Never die
Never die
[Bridge]
I won't let go of that youthful soul
Despite body and mind, my youth will never die
I won't let go of that youthful soul
Despite body and mind, my youth will never die
[Chorus]
So let the children play
Inside your heart always
And death you will defy
'Cause your youth will never die
So let the children play
Inside your heart always
And death you will defy
'Cause your youth will never die
Never die

Hang me, watch awhile
Let me see you smile as I die
Take me, as my body burns
Let me see you yearn, while I cry
[Chorus]
One step on your own

One head in the clouds
You won't let go, you're too proud
One light to the blind, and they see

Adore me as I drift away
Let me hear you say I'm fine
You cry as my body dies
All that you despised is gone away

One

[Verse 1]
Affirmative may be justified
Take from one, give to another
The goal is to be unified
Take my hand, be my brother
The payment silenced the masses
Sanctified by oppression
Unity took a back seat
Sliding further into regression
[Pre-Chorus]
One, oh, one, the only way is one
One, oh, one, the only way is one
[Chorus]
I feel angry, I feel helpless
Want to change the world, yeah
I feel violent, I feel alone
Don't try and change my mind, no
[Verse 2]
Society, blind by color
Why hold down one to raise another?
Discrimination, now on both sides
Seeds of hate blossom further
The world is headed for mutiny
When all we want is unity
We may rise and fall
But in the end, we'll meet our fate together
[Pre-Chorus]
One, oh, one, the only way is one
One, oh, one, the only way is one

One Last Breath

[Verse 1]
Please come now, I think I'm falling
I'm holding on to all I think is safe
It seems I found the road to nowhere
And I'm trying to escape
I yelled back when I heard thunder
But I'm down to one last breath
And with it, let me say
Let me say
[Chorus]
Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
"Maybe six feet ain't so far down"
[Verse 2]
I'm looking down, now that it's over
Reflecting on all of my mistakes
I thought I found the road to somewhere
Somewhere in His grace
I cried out "Heaven save me"
But I'm down to one last breath
And with it, let me say
Let me say
[Chorus]
Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
"Maybe six feet ain't so far down"
Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
"Maybe six feet ain't so far down"
I'm so far down
[Bridge]
Sad eyes follow me
But I still believe there's something left for me
So please, come stay with me
'Cause I still believe there's something left for you and me
For you and me, for you and me

Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking

Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking

On My Sleeve

[Verse 1]
The eyes around me are so cold
With every chance they steal my soul
So walk with me, talk with me
Hold my hand I'm stumbling
In consequence here is me alive
[Pre-Chorus]
Can you fix what's made to be broken
I can't fix what's made to be
[Chorus]
My heart is tattooed on my sleeve
I'm not hiding, no
It only hurts to breathe
My heart is tattooed on my sleeve
I know it's blinding, no
It only hurts to breathe
[Verse 2]
Standing now I'm alone
I need answers, tell me everything you know
So heavy is the night
Exhausted
Whispers tend to crucify my mind
I'm fighting but I'm blind
[Pre-Chorus]
Can you fix what's made to be broken
I can't fix what's made to be
[Chorus]
My heart is tattooed on my sleeve
I'm not hiding, no

Can you hear me?
Mistakes have cost me years
Do they cost you?
Are you like me?
Tell me, please

It only hurts to breathe
My heart is tattooed on my sleeve
I know it's blinding, no
It only hurts, it only hurts

Overcome

[Verse 1]
Don't cry victim to me
Everything we are and used to be is buried and gone
Now it's my turn to speak
It's my turn to expose and release what's been killing me
[Pre-Chorus]
I'll be damned fighting you
It's impossible, impossible
Say goodbye with no sympathy
[Chorus]
I'm entitled to overcome
Completely stunned, I'm numb
Knock me down, throw me to the floor
There's no pain, I can't feel no more
I'm entitled to overcome
Overcome
[Verse 2]
Finally see what's beneath
Everything I am and hope to be cannot be lost
[Pre-Chorus]
I'll be damned fighting you
You're impossible, impossible
Say goodbye with no sympathy

I'm entitled to overcome
Completely stunned, I'm numb
Knock me down, throw me to the floor
There's no pain, I can't feel no more
I'm entitled to overcome
Overcome
[Bridge]
(Overcome)
You'll never know what I was thinking before you came 'round
Take a step, take a breath, put your guard down

I cannot worry anymore of what you think of me
I may be crazy, but I'm buried in your memory
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
I'm entitled to overcome
Completely stunned, I'm numb
Knock me down, throw me to the floor
There's no pain, I can't feel no more

In a state of self-denial
Is it worthwhile?
Sell my pity for a dime
Yeah, just one dime
Sell my pity for a dime

Can you help me out, can you lend me a hand?
It's safe to say that I'm stuck again
Trapped between this life and the light
I just can't figure out, how to make it right
[Pre-Chorus]
A thousand times before
I've wondered if there's something more, something more
[Chorus]
I feel it's going to rain like this for days
So let it rain down and wash everything away
I hope that tomorrow the sun will shine
With every tomorrow comes another life
I feel it's going to rain, for days and days
(I feel it's going to rain)
[Verse 2]
I tried to figure out, I can't understand
What it means to be whole again
Trapped between the truth and the consequence
Nothing's real, nothing's making sense
[Pre-Chorus]
A thousand times before
I've wondered if there's something more, something more
[Chorus]
I feel it's going to rain like this for days
So let it rain down and wash everything away
I hope that tomorrow the sun will shine
I feel it's going to rain like this, rain like this, rain like this
[Bridge]
Fall down, wash away my yesterdays
Fall down, so let the rain fall down on me
[Chorus]
I feel it's going to rain like this for days
So let it rain down and wash everything away
I hope that tomorrow the sun will shine
I feel it's going to rain like this, rain like this
[Outro]
So let the rain fall
I feel it's going to rain like this rain like this
So let the rain fall down
I feel it's going to rain like this
I feel it's going to rain

Reach Out

Welcome friends
I have nothing to hide
The journey's end has left a mark inside
I'm sure you've heard the rumors, jealousies
And all the lies
I do not fear you
Do you fear me?
Love again
I reach out
Can't give in
Learn to listen to that voice within my soul
I reach out
Can't give in
Learn to listen to it
No victims
These choices were all mine
Looking within
These scars will heal with time
There's no excuse for weakness, selfishness
Or compromise
I do not fear you
Do you fear me?
Love again
I reach out
Can't give in
Learn to listen to that voice within my soul
I reach out
Can't give in
Learn to listen to it
I reach out
I reach out
Can't give in
Can't give in
I reach out (I reach out)
I give in
Can we start again?
I finally hear this reason
I wish there was no fall
I'll never be alone again
Screaming at the walls
I reach out
I reach out
I reach out
I reach out
I reach out
Can't give in
Learn to listen to that voice within my soul
I reach out
Can't give in
Learn to listen to it
I reach out
Can't give in
Learn to listen to that voice within my soul
I reach out
Can't give in
Learn to listen to it
Learn to listen to it
Learn to listen to it
Listen to that voice within my soul

Riders on the Storm

[Chorus]
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Into this house we're born
Into this world we're thrown
Like a dog without a bone
An actor out on loan
Riders on the storm
[Verse]
There's a killer on the road
His brain is squirming like a toad
Take a long holiday
Let your children play
If you give this man a ride
Sweet family will die
Killer on the road
Girl, you got to love your man[x2]
Take him by the hand
Make him understand
The world on you depends
Our life will never end
Girl, you got to love your man
[Chorus]
[Outro]

Say I

[Verse 1]
The dust has finally settled on the field of human clay
Just enough light has shown through to tell the night from the day
We're incomplete and hollow
For our maker has gone away

We'll surely melt in the rain
Say I
Say I
[Chorus]

And see they lie (Because he lies)

Silent teacher, hold my hand
And lead me to the promised land like gold
Silent teacher, please define
Is ordinary life, it won't be me to find it, me to find it

I work well with my head in the clouds
I won't stumble when I walk a fine line
Can you tell me which way to go?
So I can bury you with all of my might

Am I who you want me to be?

Stand Here With Me

[Verse 1]
You always reached out to me and helped me believe
All those memories we share, I will cherish every one of them
For the truth of it is there's a right way to live and you showed me
So now you live on in the words of a song, you're a melody
[Chorus]
'Cause you stand here with me now, yeah
'Cause you stand here with me now, yeah
[Verse 2]
Just when the fear blinded me, you taught me to dream
I'll give you everything I am and still fall short of what you've done for me
In this life that I live I hope I can give love unselfishly
I've learned the world is bigger than me you're my daily dose of reality
[Chorus]
'Cause you stand here with me now, yeah
'Cause you stand here with me now, yeah
On and on we sing this song
'Cause you stand here with me

Suddenly

[Verse 1]
A nature to nurture, an instinct to sin
What's underneath the skin you live in?
You trade your unlimited, your precious creation
You will submit, you will give in
[Chorus]
Suddenly I have no strength at all
So suddenly hit with all I've lost
Suddenly my world is falling apart
So suddenly, so suddenly
Suddenly
[Verse 2]
You say you're a victim, but that's just a symptom
It's so very clear you volunteered
Why are you fighting just stop your denying
Own up to the sin you bury within
[Chorus]
Suddenly I have no strength at all
So suddenly hit with all I've lost
Suddenly my world is falling apart
So suddenly, so suddenly
Suddenly
[Bridge]
I have no strength at all
I've been hit with a loss
So suddenly my world falls apart
I have no strength at all
I've been hit with a loss
Suddenly my world falls apart
(My world) Falls apart (My world)
[Chorus]
Suddenly I have no strength at all
So suddenly hit with all I've lost
Suddenly my world is falling apart
So suddenly, so suddenly
Suddenly I have no strength at all
So suddenly hit, so suddenly hit
Suddenly my world is falling apart
So suddenly, so suddenly
Suddenly

The Song You Sing

[Verse 1]
Woke up and had a face to face
Guess my reflection had a lot to say
Why let my worries steal my days
It just brings me down
[Chorus]
Does the song you sing have enough meaning?
Inspire us to sing along
Does the song you sing Keep echoing?
Inspire us to sing the song you sing
[Verse 2]
What's wrong with the world today
Tell me what's all the talk about
Lately, I've been in a real bad place
Can't let the world bring me down
[Chorus]
Does the song you sing have enough meaning?
Inspire us to sing along
Does the song you sing Keep echoing?
Inspire us to sing the song you sing
[Bridge]
I hope (I hope)
The words I wrote (The words I wrote)
Keep calling out (Keep calling out)
Keep calling out
Forever (Forever)
Let them sing (Let them sing)
That song you sing, that song you sing
I hope (I hope)
The words I wrote (The words I wrote)
Keep calling out, keep calling out
Forever (Forever)
Let them ring (Let them ring)
Hear them echoing, hear them echoing

Does the song you sing have enough meaning?
Inspire us to sing along
Does the song you sing Keep echoing?
Inspire us to sing the song you sing

Time

[Verse 1]
I can't explain, can't quite put my finger on it
The difference that makes us so different
We've said everything, our words only betrayed us
Nothing is left nothing was left unsaid
[Chorus]
This time I have nothing left to lose
I'm stuck the second hand won't move
It's about time that I speak my mind
It's about time, about time I find
Pieces of me I have lost
Without any choice I move on
Hey time, you're no friend of mine
Hey time, you're no friend of mine
[Verse 2]
You cover yourself you cover your skin
You cover yourself like you cover your sins
Please untie my hands, I'm a sinner, I'm a man
I ask for one minute to make you understand
[Chorus]
This time I have nothing left to lose
I'm stuck the second hand won't move
It's about time that I speak my mind
It's about time, about time I find
Pieces of me I have lost
Without any choice I move on
Hey time, you're no friend of mine
Hey time, you're no friend of mine
[Bridge]
Will you be there to catch me when I stumble, when I fall
When I fall
It's so very clear you left me when I had no one at all
No one at all
Who will be there to catch me, to catch me when I stumble, when I fall?
When I fall
It's so very clear you left me, you left me with no one at all
No one at all
[Chorus]
This time I have nothing left to lose
I'm stuck the second hand won't move
It's about time that I speak my mind
It's about time, about time I find
Pieces of me I have lost
Without any choice I move on
Hey time, you're no friend of mine
Hey time, you're no friend of mine
[Outro]
No friend of mine
Time, you're no friend of mine
You're no friend of mine
Hey time, you're no friend of mine
Hey time, you're no friend of mine
The pieces of me I have lost
Without any choice I move on

But time keeps pushing so much

Your eyes stare at me in the dark
And I hope those eyes don't steal my freedom
My freedom

Then I could still hide down behind the wall

I kept up with the message inside
Lost sight of the irony of twisted faith
Lost sight of my soul and its void
[Chorus]
Think I
Think I'm unforgiven to this world
Think I
Think I'm unforgiven to this world, yeah
[Verse 2]
Took a chance at deceiving myself
To share in the consequence of lies
Childish with my reasoning and pride
Godless to the extent that I died
[Chorus]
Think I
Think I'm unforgiven to this world
Think I
Think I'm unforgiven to this world
Think I'm unforgiven
[Bridge]
No more raping innocence
No more raping innocence
No more raping innocence
No more raping innocence
Step inside the light and see
The fear of God burn inside of me
The gold was put to flame, to kill
To burn, to mold its purity
[Chorus]
Think I
Think I'm unforgiven to this world
Think I
Think I'm unforgiven to this world
Think I'm unforgiven

Wash Away The Years

She came calling one early morning
She showed her crown of thorns
She whispered softly to tell a story
About how she had been wronged
As she lay lifeless
He stole her innocence
And this is how she carried on
This is how she carried on
Well, I guess she closed her eyes
And just imagined everything's alright
But she could not hide her tears
'Cause they were sent to wash away those years
They were sent to wash away those years
My anger's violent but still I'm silent
When tragedy strikes at home
I know this decadence is shared by millions
Remember you're not alone
Remember you're not alone
Well, if you just close your eyes
And just imagine everything's alright
But do not hide your tears
'Cause they were sent to wash away those years
Well, if you just close your eyes
And just imagine everything's alright
But do not hide your tears
'Cause they were sent to wash away those years
They were sent to wash away those years
Maybe, we can wash away those moon's
For we have crossed many oceans
And we labor in between
In life there are many quotients
And I hope I find the mean's
The mean's, the mean's
Well, if you just close your eyes
And just imagine everything's alright
But do not hide your tears
'Cause they were sent to wash away those years
Well, if you just close your eyes
And just imagine everything's alright
But do not hide your tears
'Cause they were sent to wash away those years
Maybe, we can wash away those years
I hope that you can wash away those years

Weathered

[Verse 1]
I lie awake on a long, dark night
I can't seem to tame my mind
Slings and arrows are killing me inside
Maybe I can't accept the life that's mine, no
Maybe I can't accept the life that's mine
[Verse 2]
Simple living is my desperate cry
Been trading love with indifference
And yeah, it suits me just fine
I try to hold on but I'm calloused to the bone
Maybe that's why I feel alone, yeah
Maybe that's why I feel so alone
[Chorus]
'Cause me, I'm rusted and weathered
Barely holding together
I'm covered with skin that peels
And it just won't heal
I'm rusted and weathered
Barely holding together
I'm covered with skin that peels
And it just won't heal
[Post-Chorus]
No, it just won't heal, no, no, no
[Verse 3]
The sun shines and I can't avoid the light
I think I'm holding on to life too tight
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Sometimes I feel like giving up, yeah
I said, sometimes I feel like giving up
[Chorus]
'Cause me, I'm rusted and weathered
Barely holdin' together
I'm covered with skin that peels
And it just won't heal
I'm rusted and weathered
Barely holding together
I'm covered with skin that peels
And it just won't heal
[Post-Chorus]
It just won't heal, no
[Bridge]
The day reminds me of you
The night hides your truth
The earth is a voice
Speaking to you
Take all this pride
And leave it behind
'Cause one day it ends
One day we die
Believe what you will
That is your right
But I choose to win
I choose to fight
To fight
[Chorus/Outro]
'Cause me, I'm rusted and weathered
Barely holding together
I'm covered with skin that peels
And it just won't heal
I'm rusted and weathered
Barely holding together
I'm covered with skin that peels
And it just won't...
Covered with skin that peels
And it just won't...
Covered with skin that peels
And it just won't heal

What If

[Verse 1]
I can't find the rhyme in all my reason
Lost sense of time and all seasons
Feel I've been beaten down
By the words of men who have no grounds
Can't sleep beneath the trees of wisdom
When your ax has cut the roots that feed them
Forked tongues in bitter mouths
Can drive a man to bleed from inside out
[Chorus]
What if you did?
What if you lied?
What if I avenge?
What if eye for an eye?
[Verse 2]
I've seen the wicked fruit of your vine
Destroy the man who lacks a strong mind
Human pride sings a vengeful song
Inspired by the times you've been walked on
My stage is shared by many millions
Who lift their hands up high because they feel this
We are one, we are strong
The more you hold us down, the more we press on
[Chorus]
What if you did?
What if you lied?
What if I avenge?
What if eye for an eye?
[Bridge]
I know I can't hold my hate inside my mind
Because what consumes your thoughts controls your life
So I'll just ask a question, a lonely, simple question
I'll just ask one question
What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?
What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?
What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?
What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?
[Chorus]
What if you did?
What if you lied?
What if I avenge?
What if eye for an eye?
What if your words
Could be judged like a crime?
[Outro]
What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?
What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?
What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?
What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?

What’s This Life For

[Verse 1]
Hurray for a child that makes it through
If there's any way because
The answer lies in you
They're laid to rest before
They've known just what to do
Their souls are lost because
They could never find
[Chorus]
What's this life for?
What's this life for?
What's this life for?
What's this life for?
[Verse 2]
I see your soul, it's kind of gray
You see my heart, you look away
You see my wrist, I know your pain
I know your purpose on your plane
Don't say a last prayer because
You could never find
[Chorus]
What's this life for?
What's this life for?
What's this life for?
What's this life for?

But they ain't here anymore
Don't have to settle the score
'Cause we all live under the reign
Of one king
But they ain't here anymore
Don't have to settle no goddamn score
'Cause we all live under the reign
Of just as you know of one king, one king, one king
But they ain't here anymore
Don't have to settle no goddamn score
'Cause we all live under the reign
Of just as you know of one king, one king, one king
But they ain't here anymore

Who’s Got My Back

[Intro: Cherokee Indian Prayer]
[Verse 1]
Run, hide
All that was sacred to us, sacred to us
See the signs
The covenant has been broken by mankind
Leaving us with no shoulder, with no shoulder
[Pre-Chorus]
To rest our head on
To rest our head on
To rest our head on
[Chorus]
Who's got my back now
When all we have left is deceptive?
So disconnected
What is the truth now?
[Post-Chorus]
(What is the truth now?)
[Verse 2]
There's still time
All that has been devastated can be recreated
Realize
We pick up the broken pieces of our lives
Giving ourselves to each other, ourselves to each other
[Pre-Chorus]
To rest our head on
To rest our head on
To rest our head on
[Chorus]
Who's got my back now
When all we have left is deceptive?
So disconnected
What is the truth now?
Who's got my back now
When all we have left is deceptive?
So disconnected
What is the truth now?
[Bridge]
What is the truth now?
Tell me the truth now
What is the truth now?
What is the truth now?
Tell us the truth
[Chorus]
Who's got my back now
When all we have left is deceptive?
So disconnected
What is the truth now?
Who's got my back now
When all we have left is deceptive?
So disconnected
What is the truth now?
[Post-Chorus]
What is the truth now?
Tell us the truth now
What is the truth now?
Tell us the truth now

Why (Demo)

[Verse 1]
Cradle empty people
I struggle for power see no relief
Ingurgitated thorn wrapped at my jaw
In to a feed a thief
My own fate in motion now looking back on original plan
Religion scared hoping stealing questions the good of man
[Chorus]
Why Why Why oh Why?
Why Why Oh Why?
Why Why Why oh Why?
Why? Why?
Why Why Why Why Why?
[Verse 2]
Searching, waiting, hoping
Nothing in my hand
Grabbed this life, this question
I need to know why? Know why?
Understanding nothing I'm blinking insane
More I'm in question, swell the brain
[Chorus]
Why Why Why oh Why?
Why Why Oh Why?
Why Why Why oh Why?
Why? Why?
Why Why Why Why Why?
God up in the sky
I'll wait if you try
See me humble
See me cry
The only question I need to know
Why?
Why Oh Why? [x3]

With Arms Wide Open (Live at Freeman Coliseum / 1999)

[Intro]
This next song is a song that's very personal to me
And it's kind of a mood swing in the show
It's a lot different than the last two songs
It's about personal insecurities and fears
About having to deal with responsibilities
And how you feel about welcoming a new life in the world that's yours
If you haven't had that happen to you already, I'm sure someday you will
This song's called, "With Arms Wide Open"
[Verse 1]
Well, I just heard the news today
It seems my life is gonna change
I close my eyes, begin to pray
Then tears of joy stream down my face
[Chorus]
With arms wide opеn, under the sunlight
Welcomе to this place, I'll show you everything
With arms wide open
With arms wide open
[Verse 2]
Well, I don't know if I'm ready
To be the man I have to be
I'll take a breath, I'll take her by my side
I stand in awe, I've created life
[Chorus]
With arms wide open, under the sunlight
Welcome to this place, I'll show you everything
With arms wide open, now everything has changed
I'll show you love, I'll show you everything
With arms wide open
With arms wide open
[Bridge]
I'll show you everything, oh, yeah
With arms wide open
Wide open
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
If I had just one wish, only one demand
I hope he's not like me, I hope he understands
That he can take this life and hold it by the hand
And he can greet the world with arms wide open
[Chorus]
With arms wide open, under the sunlight
Welcome to this place, I'll show you everything
With arms wide open, now everything has changed
I'll show you love, I'll show you everything
With arms wide open
With arms wide open
[Outro]
I'll show you everything, oh, yeah
With arms wide open
Wide open
Wide open
Thank you

Young Grow Old

[Verse 1]
He said he's falling to pieces
Fighting the boy and the man
Over his shoulder there was freedom
But consciousness has tied his hands
Embodied youth was his distinction
Now inhibition's in demand
So driven by his fear of weakness
But that's his key to understand
[Chorus]
So far in a distant land
There's a fight between boy and man
See the light through the open door
Sit and watch as the young grow old
[Verse 2]
Trading places in the circle
Turn the glass, spill the sand
They say that time can make a difference
But age doesn't make you a man
[Chorus]
So far in a distant land
There's a fight between boy and man
See the light through the open door
Sit and watch as the young grow old
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge]
So young, but overblown
So young, but overblown
So young, but overblown (So young, but overblown)
So young, but overblown
[Verse 3]
Take a look now, see the boy is weakened
Watch him fade, watch him fade away
Take a bow and the boy is defeated
Is this the way, this the way?
[Chorus]
So far in a distant land
There's a fight between boy and man
See the light through the open door
Sit and watch as the young grow old
